# Mathematical Function: Divergence

This is a placeholder file for the mathematical description of the Divergence operator.

## Definition

The divergence is a scalar-valued function that measures the rate at which a vector field is expanding or contracting at a given point.

## Properties

- Linearity: $\nabla \cdot (F + G) = \nabla \cdot F + \nabla \cdot G$
- Product rule: $\nabla \cdot (fF) = f\nabla \cdot F + F \cdot \nabla f$

## Discretization

This section will describe how the divergence operator is discretized in MOLE.
