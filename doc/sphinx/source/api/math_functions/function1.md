# Mathematical Function: Gradient

This is a placeholder file for the mathematical description of the Gradient operator.

## Definition

The gradient is a vector-valued function that represents the rate of change of a scalar field.

## Properties

- Linearity: $\nabla(f + g) = \nabla f + \nabla g$
- Product rule: $\nabla(fg) = f\nabla g + g\nabla f$

## Discretization

This section will describe how the gradient operator is discretized in MOLE.
