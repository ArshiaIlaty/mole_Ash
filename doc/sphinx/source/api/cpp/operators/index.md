# <span class="operator-icon">ðŸ§®</span> Operators

The MOLE library provides a set of high-order mimetic operators for solving partial differential equations. These operators are designed to maintain important mathematical properties of the continuous operators they approximate.

```{admonition} What are Mimetic Operators?
:class: note
Mimetic operators are discrete analogs of continuous differential operators that preserve important mathematical properties of the continuum problem at the discrete level.

## Common Features

All operators in MOLE share these common characteristics:

* **High-order accuracy**: Operators can be constructed with arbitrary order of accuracy
* **Mimetic properties preservation**: Conservation of important mathematical properties
* **Support for various grid types**: Uniform, non-uniform, and curvilinear grids
* **Efficient sparse matrix implementation**: Optimized for computational performance
