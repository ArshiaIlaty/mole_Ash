function D = div2DPer(k, m, dx, n, dy)
% Returns a two-dimensional mimetic divergence operator
% when the boundary condition is periodic

% Parameters:
%                k : Order of accuracy
%                m : Number of cells along x-axis
%               dx : Step size along x-axis
%                n : Number of cells along y-axis
%               dy : Step size along y-axis
    
    D = - grad2DPer(k, m, dx, n, dy)';
